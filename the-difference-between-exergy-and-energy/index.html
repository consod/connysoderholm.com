A kilowatt is a kilowatt, right? When we are talking about energy, a kilowatt (kW) is always equal to a kilowatt. It is when we actually examine what the kilowatt contains that we find that so might not be the case. Read on to find out why one kilowatt can be better than another.</p><p>Imagine that you have an engine running. The engine is spinning a shaft, creating work. The output created from the energy is in the form of mechanical energy. You can drive a generator to produce electricity, or use it to propel your ship forward. You can do quite a lot with the mechanical energy.</p><p>The engine requires cooling in order to not overheat. Some of the energy supplied with the fuel is thus converted into heat. What can you do with the warm cooling water? Can you spin your shaft with it, to drive your generator or shaft? No, you can use it for heating and not much else (You could use a heat engine of course, but then you would have to convert the heat to work).</p><p>It seems like mechanical energy and electrical energy is of more worth to us than heat. When looking from the energy&nbsp;perspective, they are equal. One kilowatt of mechanical energy is the same as one kilowatt of heat contained in the cooling water. The difference is that they cannot provide the same amount of work. What do we then call this difference? Worse energy? Not as good energy?</p><p>As we are measuring how much work we can extract from the energy, we are calling it <em><strong>exergy</strong></em>. In any process where you transform energy, you are lowering the transformed energy's capacity to do work. Exergy is thus a measure of the quality of the energy. When we transform energy into another form, the energy that we cannot use for producing work again is called <em><strong>anergy</strong></em>. It is interesting to note that exergy can actually be destroyed. This is true for all irreversible processes.</p><figure class="size-full wp-image-202"><a href="https://consod.github.io/connysoderholm.com/media/posts/7/exergy.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://consod.github.io/connysoderholm.com/media/posts/7/exergy.png" alt="Energy = Exergy + Anergy" width="461" height="368" sizes="(min-width: 1260px) calc(3.22vw + 703px), (min-width: 900px) calc(50.59vw + 116px), (min-width: 840px) calc(5vw + 684px), calc(85.58vw + 23px)" srcset="https://consod.github.io/connysoderholm.com/media/posts/7/responsive/exergy-xs.png 320w, https://consod.github.io/connysoderholm.com/media/posts/7/responsive/exergy-sm.png 480w, https://consod.github.io/connysoderholm.com/media/posts/7/responsive/exergy-md.png 768w"></a></figure>Energy = Exergy + Anergy<p></p><p>To sum all of this up. A kW is not always the same as a kW. Whenever you transform energy to another form in an irreversible process you lower the exergy. The energy you cannot use for work again is called anergy. All energy is created equal, the only difference is what we can do with it.
